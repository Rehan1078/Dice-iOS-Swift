# Dicee – My First iOS App 🎲

This is my **first iOS app** created as part of my Swift learning journey. While following the [App Brewery Complete iOS Bootcamp](https://www.appbrewery.co/), I built this app to practice core Swift concepts, Xcode functionality, and basic UI/UX design.

## About the App

Dicee is a simple Las Vegas-style dice roller. You can roll the dice:

- By pressing a button  
- Or by shaking your iPhone  

It’s a fun, interactive way to **learn programming fundamentals** while making a usable app.

## Learning Goals & Achievements

While building this app, I learned:

- How to clone and work with an Xcode project from GitHub  
- Connecting Interface Builder elements to code using `IBActions` and `IBOutlets`  
- Using Swift constants, variables, and arrays  
- Implementing randomisation in Swift  
- Debugging and testing with the Xcode console  
- Writing clean, commented, and structured code  

This project marked the start of my **iOS development journey**, giving me confidence to build more advanced apps in Swift.
